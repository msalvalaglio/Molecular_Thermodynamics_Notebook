The idea of ensemble averaging can also be expressed in terms of an average over all such microstates (which comprise the ensemble). A given macroscopic property, A, and its microscopic function a = a(x), which is a function of the positions and momenta of a system, i.e. the phase space vector, are related by

1 Ùè∞ÇN
A = ‚ü®a‚ü©ensemble = N a(xŒª)
Œª=1 where xŒª is the microstate of the Œªth member of the ensemble.

However, recall the original problem of determining the microscopic detailed motion of each individual particle in a system. In reality, measurements are made only on a single system and all the microscopic detailed motion is present. However, what one observes is still an average, but it is an average over time of the detailed motion, an average that also washes out the microscopic details. Thus, the time average and the ensemble average should be equivalent, i.e.

1Ùè∞ÉT
A = ‚ü®a‚ü©ensemble = lim dt a(x(t))
This statement is known as the ergodic hypothesis. A system that is ergodic is one for which, given an infinite amount of time, it will visit all possible microscopic states available to it (for Hamiltonian dynamics, this means it will visit all points on the constant energy hypersurface). No one has yet been able to prove that a particular system is truly ergodic, hence the above statement cannot be more than a supposition. However, it states that if a system is ergodic, then the ensemble average of a property A(x) can be equated to a time average of the property over an ergodic tra jectory.
