    "# Week 3 Exercise: Second Virial Coefficient from Interatomic potentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we will investigate the emergence of non-idealities in the volumetri behavior of pure fluids by computing an expression of the P/v isotherm in the case of particles interacting with a square well potential, defined by the expression: $\\Gamma_{ii}=0$ for $r>R\\sigma$ ; $-\\epsilon$ for $\\sigma<r\\leq{R}\\sigma$ ; $\\infty$ for $r \\leq \\sigma$\n",
    "\n",
    "This potential is a function of three parameters: $\\sigma$, $\\epsilon$, and $R$. It is easy to see that for $\\sigma, \\epsilon \\rightarrow {0}$ the behavior of the gas is ideal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this exercise is to estimate the deviation from the ideal Gas volumetric behavior at constant temperature, as a function of increasing values of $\\sigma$, $\\epsilon$, and $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In solving the problem remember that the second order virial coefficient can be computed from $\\Gamma_{ii}$ as: \n",
