# # 2. Pervaporation

# ## 2.1 Vapour-Liquid Equilibrium in a Pervaporation unit

# In pervaporation processes the feed/retentate is liquid, while the permeate is in the vapour phase. 
# In this process, evaporation and permeation of different chemical through a semipermeable membrane take place simultaneously.    
# 
# In order to tame the complexity of the processes taking place in this unit, a typical modelling assumption is that Vapour liquid equilibrium is established on the feed retentate side and permeation through the membrane takes place in the vapour phase.  
# 
# Hence, pervaporation can be treated as a gas permeation problem by introducing a _virtual vapour phase_ in equilibrium with the liquid on the retentate side of the membrane. 
# 
# The driving force for a specie $i$ can thus be written as the difference in the partial pressure for component $i$ in this virtual vapour phase, and in the real vapour phase on the permeate side. 

# ## 2.2 Vapour-Liquid Equilibrium conditions

# To express the partial pressure of component $i$ in a vapour phase in equilibrium with the liquid on the retentate side we shall begin by expressing the fundamental condition that has to be fulfilled by all species at thermodynamic equilibrium: 
# 
# $$
# \mu_i^L(T,P,\vec{x})=\mu_i^V(T,P,\vec{y})
# $$(PVAPeq:fund)
# 
# where $\mu_i^L(T,P,\vec{x})$ and $\mu_i^V(T,P,\vec{y})$ are the chemical potentials for specie $i$ in the liquid and vapour phase, respectively. 
# 
# For mixtures of ideal gases the chemical potential is conveniently expressed in differential form as a function of the partial pressure of component $i$, $p_i$ as $d\mu_i=RTd\ln{p_i}$.  
# In analogy with this expression in the case of real gases fugacity $f_i$ is introduced, leading to the differential expression $d\mu_i=RTd\ln{f_i}$. 
# Integrating this expression between the phases in equilibrium yields: 
# 
# $$
# \int_{L,T,P,\vec{x}}^{V,T,P,\vec{y}}d\mu_i=\int_{L,T,P,\vec{x}}^{V,T,P,\vec{y}}RTd\ln{f_i}
# $$
# $$
# \mu_i^V(T,P,\vec{y})-\mu_i^L(T,P,\vec{x})=RT\ln\frac{f_i^V(T,P,\vec{y}}{f_i^L(T,P,\vec{x})}
# $$(PVAPeq:chempot)
# 
# 
# Hence, the equilibrium condition expressed by Eq. {eq}`PVAPeq:fund` can be conveniently stated as: 
# 
# $$
# f_i^V(T,P,\vec{y})=f_i^L(T,P,\vec{x})
# $$(PVAPeq:EQUI)
# 
# The left-hand term can be written as: 
# 
# $$
# f_i^V(T,P,\vec{y})=\phi(T,P,\vec{y})Py_i
# $$(PVAPeq:vapour)
# 
# where $\phi(T,P,\vec{y})$ is the fugacity coefficient, $P$ the pressure and $y_i$ the molar fraction in the vapour phase. 
# 
# The right hand side term can instead be written as: 
# 
# $$
# f_i^L(T,P,\vec{x})=\gamma_i(T,P,\vec{x})x_i\phi(T,P^o(T))P^o(T)e^{\frac{v_i(P-P^o(T))}{RT}}
# $$(PVAPeq:liquid)
# 
# where $x_i$ is the molar fraction of component $i$ in the liquid phase, $\gamma_i(T,P,\vec{x})$ is the activity coefficient for component i in the liquid mixture, $P^o(T)$ is the equilibrium vapour pressure of the pure component $i$, $\phi(T,P^o(T))$ is the fugacity coefficient for the pure component $i$ at $T$ and $P^o(T)$, and the term $e^{\frac{v_i(P-P^o(T))}{RT}}$ is the Poynting correction. For a discussion on the origin of the Poynting correction please refer to the notes on osmosis. 
# 
# Introducing Eq.{eq}`PVAPeq:vapour` and Eq. {eq}`PVAPeq:liquid` in Eq.{eq}`PVAPeq:EQUI`, while considering negligible the Poynting correction, and ideal gas approximation applicable yields: 
# 
# $$
# Py_i=\gamma_i(T,P,\vec{x})P^o(T)x_i
# $$(PVAPeq:final)
# 
# It should be noted that introducing the further hypothesis of ideal liquid mixture yields the Raoult law: 
# 
# $$
# Py_i=P^o(T)x_i
# $$(PVAPeq:Raoult)

# ## 2.3 Flux Equation in a pervaporation Unit

# Considering now a binary mixture of components $i$ and $j$, the flux equation for species $i$ in a pervaporation unit is: 
# 
# $$
# J_i=\frac{P_i}{l}\left(\gamma_i(T,P,\vec{x})x^r_ip_i^o(T)-p_py^p_i\right)
# $$(PVAPeq:flux)
# 
# where $P_i$ is the permeability of species $i$ through the membrane, $l$ the thickness of the membrane, $\gamma_i(T,P,\vec{x})x^r_ip_i^o(T)$ is the partial pressure in the virtual vapour phase in equilibrium with the liquid on the retentate side, $p_p$ the pressure on the permeate side, and $y^p_i$ the molar fraction of component $i$ in the real vapour phase on the permeate side.
# 
# The flux equation of component $j$ can be expressed as a function of the molar fractions of component $i$ taking advantage of the stoichiometric constraints $\sum_{i=1}^{N}x^r_i=1$, $\sum_{i=1}^{N}y^p_i=1$. 
# 
# $$
# J_j=\frac{P_j}{l}\left(\gamma_j(T,P,\vec{x})(1-x^r_i)p_j^o(T)-p_p(1-y^p_i)\right)
# $$(PVAPeq:flux2)
