# # Week 2 Exercise: The harmonic oscillator. 
# 
# Given a 1D Harmonic oscillator with characteristic frequency $\omega=5$Hz, mass of 20, starting at the initial position of 1, with an initial momentum of 1. 
# 
# - Can You define the coordinates of the Phase space of the Harmonic oscillator? 
# 
# - How would you represent the motion of the Harmonic oscillator in Phase Space? 
# 
# - What is the most probable state for the Harmonic oscillator?
