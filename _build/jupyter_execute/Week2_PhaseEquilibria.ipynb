    "# Liquid/Vapour Equilibrium conditions: deriving the Raoult Equation \n",

    "To express the partial pressure of component $i$ in a vapour phase in equilibrium with a multicomponent liquid phase we shall begin by expressing the fundamental condition that has to be fulfilled by all species at thermodynamic equilibrium at constant $T$ and $P$: \n",

    "$$(PVAPeq:fund)\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_i^L(T,P,\\vec{x})$ and $\\mu_i^V(T,P,\\vec{y})$ are the chemical potentials for specie $i$ in the liquid and vapour phase, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "For mixtures of ideal gases the chemical potential is conveniently expressed in differential form as a function of the partial pressure of component $i$, $p_i$ as $d\\mu_i=RTd\\ln{p_i}$. This result is obtained integrating the Gibbs-Duhem equation (_can you show it?_). \n",
    "\n",
    "In analogy with this expression in the case of real gases fugacity $f_i$ is introduced, defined as the partial pressure multiplied by a fugacity coefficient $\\phi_i$, and leading to the differential expression $d\\mu_i=RTd\\ln{f_i}$. \n",
