    "# The Microcanonical Ensemble\n",
    "\n",
    "The microcanonical ensemble is built upon the so called postulate of equal a priori probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Postulate of equal a priori probabilities: For an isolated macroscopic system in equilibrium, all microscopic states corresponding to the same set of macroscopic observables are equally probable._\n",
    "\n",
    "To intuitively absorb the idea of ensemble let's consider a system and its phase space vector $\\mathbf{x}(t)$, evolving in time at constant total energy, volume and number of particles. The configurations sampled, i.e. the realizations of $\\mathbf{x}$ that constitute $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ are sampling the the constant energy hypersurface and are therefore equally probable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of equally probable states $\\Omega(N,V,E)$ defines the __partition function__ for the Microcanonical ensemble. \n",
    "\n",
    "The partition function of the microcanonical ensemble is proportional to the integral in phase space over all the states at constant Energy: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Omega(N,V,E)\\propto\\int{d\\mathbf{x}}\\delta(H(\\mathbf{x})-E)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the proportionality constant is equal to: $C_N=E_0/N!h^{3N}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $h$ is a constant with units Energy$\\times$Time, and  $E_0$ is a constant having units of energy. The extra factor of  $E_0$ is needed because the $\\delta$ function has units of inverse energy. Such a constant however has no effect at all on any properties). Thus,  $\\Omega(N,V,E)$ is non-dimensional. \n",
    "\n",
    "The microcanonical partition function quantify the number of microstates accessible to a system at constant energy. \n",
    "Boltzmann identified $\\Omega(N,V,E)$ as the microscopic quantity defining $S$ - the Entropy - which we was introduced as a postulate while stating the second law of Thermodynamics. As $S$,  $\\Omega(N,V,E)$ is a natural function of $N$, $V$ and $E$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The famous Boltzmann's relation between $S$ and  $\\Omega(N,V,E)$ is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S(N,V,E)=k\\ln{\\Omega(N,V,E)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where k is Boltzmann's constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a key relation, as it establishes a connection between the macroscopically measurable thermodynamic properties of a system and its microscopic details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, by recalling the relationships introduced in Week 1, defining T and the forces associated with the extensive mechanical variables we get: \n",
